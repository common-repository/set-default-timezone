Requires at least: 2.0
Tested up to: 2.7
Stable tag: trunk

Experiencing notices about setting default timezone in PHP 5.1+. This plugin will prevent that notice.

== Description ==

'''Do not use this plugin if you are using PHP 5.1+ and WordPress 2.8!''' 

WordPress 2.8 already includes the fix that obsoletes this plugin. Furthermore, WordPress 2.8 also includes timezone changes that allows you to set your timezone that you are in. This is better than what this plugin does, which only allows for setting the timezone to GMT+0.

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin titled "Set Default Timezone" through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
